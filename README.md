# Serverless Image Processing
This project involves creating a serverless image processing system using AWS services. The system automatically converts color images to grayscale. It leverages AWS Lambda for executing the image conversion logic, Amazon S3 for storing the images, and AWS API Gateway for triggering the process. This setup ensures scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of maintenance by eliminating the need for managing servers.
